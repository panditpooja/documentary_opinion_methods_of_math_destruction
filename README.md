# My Opinion on Cathy O’Neil’s Talk: *Weapons of Math Destruction*

This repository contains my personal reflection on Cathy O’Neil’s thought-provoking talk *“Weapons of Math Destruction”*. The talk critiques the pervasive and often destructive role that mathematical models and algorithms play in contemporary society. As a Master's student in Information Science, I found her analysis highly valuable for understanding the ethical dimensions and practical ramifications of algorithms in real-world contexts, especially in domains affecting human lives such as education, finance, hiring, and criminal justice.

> *“Many algorithms, while presented as objective and mathematically rigorous, embed human biases and subjective definitions of ‘success’—challenging the misconception that data and math are inherently neutral. This resonates deeply with the ongoing discourse in my field on algorithmic fairness and transparency. The examples of teacher value-added models, recidivism risk scores, and predictive policing illustrate how blindly trusting opaque models harms vulnerable communities rather than improving outcomes. O’Neil’s call for ethical frameworks, akin to a ‘Hippocratic oath’ for data scientists, encapsulates a pivotal step toward professional responsibility in this domain.”*
