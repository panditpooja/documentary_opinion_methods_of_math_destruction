# My Opinion on Cathy O’Neil’s Talk: *Weapons of Math Destruction*

This repository contains my documentary opinion on Cathy O’Neil’s thought-provoking talk *“Weapons of Math Destruction”*. 

Cathy O’Neil’s discussion provides a profound and sobering critique of the pervasive and often destructive role that mathematical models and algorithms play in contemporary society. As a master's student in data science, I found her analysis highly valuable for understanding the ethical dimensions and practical ramifications of algorithms in real-world contexts, especially in domains affecting human lives such as education, finance, hiring, and criminal justice.
